Sentence 2 is essentially a shortened version of Sentence 1 that omits some biographical details but retains the main points.\n\nSince Sentence 2 contains all the information that's in Sentence 1 except for the birth date and location, and doesn't contradict anything, these sentences are essentially equivalent in their core meaning.\n\nequivalent",
