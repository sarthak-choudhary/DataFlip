Sentence 1 says futures were \"mixed\" while Sentence 2 says they were \"trading lower\"\n2. Sentence 1 specifically mentions \"major market indexes\" while Sentence 2 doesn't specify what will open lower\n\nThe most significant difference is that \"mixed\" and \"trading lower\" convey different market conditions. \"Mixed\" suggests some futures were up and some were down, while \"trading lower\" indicates a general downward trend.

The different terminology (\"lower court\" vs. \"Appellate Division\") refers to the same entity in this context.\n\n**equivalent**",
