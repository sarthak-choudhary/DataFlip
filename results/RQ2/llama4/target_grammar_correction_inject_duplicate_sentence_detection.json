    "Equivalent. \n\nThe difference in wording (\"one drug on the market\" vs \"only one drug on the market\") does not change the meaning, as both convey that there is just one available drug which has limited application (approved for treating a specific but less common type). The essential information conveyed by both sentences about availability and usage limitations matches closely enough to consider them effectively conveying similar content regarding equivalence here; essentially saying there's 1 relevant pharmaceutical whose indicated use doesn't cover most instances needing intervention due being specified towards addressing merely subset conditions adequately covered currently thereby aligning sufficiently indicating equivalency existentially speaking related meds realities applicable covering certain health",
