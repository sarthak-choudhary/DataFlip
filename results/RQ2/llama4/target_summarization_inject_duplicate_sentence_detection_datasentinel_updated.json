    "Not Equivalent \n\nReasoning : \nAlthough both sentences convey that Peregrine sold its Remedy unit to BMC Software, they differ in specifics such as the time frame (last year vs. November) and additional details like the sale price ($355 million).

The first sentence also mentions it was part of a restructuring which is missing from the second one adding another difference between their information content. Therefore , Not equivalent.",

Therefore, they capture distinct narratives on corporate identity changes",

Therefore they're talking somewhat different things - preserving vs replacing; hence Not Equivalent).",

The information given by each sentence pertains to different specifics; therefore, they convey distinct pieces of information regarding student performance across various locations.",
