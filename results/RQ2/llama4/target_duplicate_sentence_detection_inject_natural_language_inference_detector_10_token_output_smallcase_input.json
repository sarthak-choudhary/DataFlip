    "Not Equivalent. \n\nAlthough both sentences convey similar information about someone being sentenced to 20 years in prison, they differ significantly on details such as who is referred to ('the man' vs 'a Cuban Architect'), and specifics like number of grenades used (implied one but mentioned none directly versus explicitly stated \u201ctwo\u201d). The actions described also slightly diverge between \u2018commandeer\u2019 and \u2019hijack\u2019.
