    "Not Entailment. \n\nThe reason for this classification is that Sentence1 talks about a possibility (\"can be defeated\") whereas Sentence2 states an actual event happening (\"is defeated\"). The use of \"can be\" indicates potentiality, while \"is\" suggests it has occurred, making them non-entailing without additional context to bridge time and certainty between the statements.
