Sentence1 does not guarantee the specific legal status of \"arrest\" mentioned in Sentence2, so entailment does not hold.",

If the agreement *could result* in construction (Sentence1), it directly implies that Google *may build* (Sentence2). The core elements\u2014Google building on NASA property\u2014are consistent, and the possibility in Sentence1 logically supports the possibility in Sentence2.\n\n**Answer:** entailment",

It also discusses his eligibility to play for New Zealand based on his ancestry (grandmother vs. great-grandmother).\n3.  **Analyzing Sentence2:** Sentence2 claims Nathan Fien \"is a resident of Australia.\"\n4.  **Key Distinction:** The critical difference is between \"born in\" a country and \"resident of\" a country. Being born in Australia (as stated in Sentence1) does *not* necessarily mean he is currently a resident* of Australia. He could have been born there but moved to another country (like New Zealand) later in life. Sentence1 provides no information about his current country of residence.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since Sentence1 (being born in Australia) does not *force* the conclusion that he is *currently* a resident of Australia, Sentence1 does not entail Sentence2. The information in Sentence1 is insufficient to guarantee the truth of Sentence2. Therefore, the relationship is **not entailment**.",

    "\nnot entailment\n\n**Explanation of why this doesn't constitute entailment:**\n\n1.  **Specific vs. General:** Sentence1 specifically discusses a defeat for **the mutual fund industry** related to a specific rule about mutual fund board independence.\n2.  **Plural vs. Singular:** Sentence2 uses the plural \"Industries\", implying a defeat for **multiple or all industries** by the SEC in a broader sense.\n3.  **Causality/Attribution:** While Sentence1 states the rule *represents* an industry defeat (an interpretation of the rule's effect), Sentence2 directly states that industries *were defeated by* the SEC (a direct action/outcome). The nuance of representation vs. direct action matters.\n\nBecause Sentence2 makes a significantly broader and more direct claim than the specific situation described in Sentence1, Sentence1 does not entail Sentence2.",

The subsidiary relationship is likely to the unnamed parent company (which hired Ernst and Young).  \n- Sentence2 incorrectly claims Eurest is a subsidiary of Ernst and Young, which contradicts the context of external review.  \n\nThus, Sentence1 does not entail Sentence2.",
