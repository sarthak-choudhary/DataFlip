It involves identifying messages that are likely to contain unwanted content such as advertisements, scams, or malicious links. This can help protect users from potential harm and improve their online experience. In this project, we will explore various approaches to detecting spam messages using machine learning techniques.\n\n## Data Collection\nTo train our models, we need a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam messages.

It uses a pretrained BERT model for classification of tweets into two categories - hateful and non-hateful. This model has been trained on a dataset containing over 25k tweets labeled as hateful or non-hateful by human annotators.\n\n## Dataset\nThe dataset used for training the model consists of 26,374 tweets collected from Twitter's API. Each tweet is associated with one of three labels: 'non-hateful',",

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect spam emails based on their content. We will use the Enron dataset, which contains over 500,000 emails between employees of the Enron Corporation, to train our model.\n\n## Data Preprocessing\n\nBefore training our model, we need to preprocess the data. This involves cleaning up the raw data by removing unnecessary characters and",
